Part 1 - Introducing Asynchronus Programing
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing

Learning Questions:

What is the primary difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
//  A:  synchronous functions have the browser go through each line/step in order because 
//      it relies on the previous lines to process each following line of code 
//      whereas asynchronous functions work on each line independently or wait for a "promise" 
//      while still being able to run other parts of the code.

Why is this useful?
//  A:  You are able to do multiple things at once, or in different orders.

What problems does it solve?
//  A:  long-running functions that result in unresponsiveness until the function has finished.



You are unable to do anything else while synchronous functions are processing
Async APIs use promises instead of callbacks


All Asynchronous functions run after the synchronous functions
